                            There is actually very little about the food in Bible, either for the last supper or for
                            when risen christ visits his disciples.

                            The food present often reflects more about the artist and their local food culture/personal
                            taste. Especially in the Renaissance when it was the perfect humanist and symmetrical thing
                            to paint.
