                            <strong>Cooke</strong> coined the term, the idea to look deeply at the object itself, and
                            not what we believe it to be. Process by which to understand an object.

                            To understand an object on its own terms, begin with materials and techniques of fabrication
                            and decoration, rather than project an ahistorical interpretation based on contemporary
                            taste of prejudice.
